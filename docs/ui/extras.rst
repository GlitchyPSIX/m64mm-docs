Extra Controls
==============

These are miscellaneous controls that aren't as powerful as the other features in the program, but prove useful for machinimists.

Levitate Mario
##############

This allows you to make Mario float. Useful for animations that clip in the ground, or want to get a bottom angle of an animation.

.. note:: Some animations are restricted in the ground because of how the game treats them.

* **Slider from 0 to 5**

	0 is regular height, 5 is max height.
	
	.. warning:: This may make some animations be extremely bouncy. This behavior is because of how the game treats animations.
	
Misc. Controls
##############

Even more miscellaneous controls that don't fit into any other category.

* **Remove HUD button**
	
	This button removes the in-game HUD, allowing for recording without the counters for stars, lives, etc.
	
	.. note:: Does not affect the black bars.
